# Privacy Policy - ChatShot

**Last updated:** February 22, 2026

## Overview

ChatShot is a browser extension that captures screenshots of AI chatbot conversations. It is designed with privacy as a core principle.

## Data Collection

**ChatShot does NOT collect, store, transmit, or share any user data.** Specifically:

- No conversation content is read, stored, or sent to any server
- No screenshots are uploaded anywhere
- No analytics, tracking, or telemetry of any kind
- No cookies or local storage used for tracking
- No user accounts or registration required
- No third-party services or APIs called

## How It Works

1. The extension injects a screenshot button into supported AI chat pages
2. When clicked, it renders the visible conversation elements into an image **entirely in your browser**
3. The image is copied to your **local clipboard**
4. Nothing leaves your device

## Permissions

- `clipboardWrite`: Required to copy the screenshot image to your clipboard. This is the only permission requested.

## Supported Platforms

The extension runs on: chatgpt.com, claude.ai, doubao.com. It only activates on these specific domains.

## Changes

If this policy changes, the updated version will be published here.
